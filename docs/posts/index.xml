      <description>People have been having problems with Ubuntu recently so I proposed Arch as a replacement, but it&amp;rsquo;ll require some changes to your behavior to get a similar experience.
Arch Linux is a rolling-release distro, that means you&amp;rsquo;ll only ever need to upgrade packages since there are no formal releases.
That means you&amp;rsquo;ll always have the latest versions of the packages you have installed.
Most people think this means Arch is less stable, but this isn&amp;rsquo;t true at all, Arch has always been more stable for me than Ubuntu, Fedora or even SuSE ever was.</description>
