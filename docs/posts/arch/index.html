  <p>People have been having problems with Ubuntu recently so I proposed Arch as a replacement, but it&rsquo;ll require some changes to your behavior to get a similar experience.</p>

<p>Arch Linux is a rolling-release distro, that means you&rsquo;ll only ever need to upgrade packages since there are no formal releases.</p>

<p>That means you&rsquo;ll always have the latest versions of the packages you have installed.</p>

<p>Most people think this means Arch is less stable, but this isn&rsquo;t true at all, Arch has always been more stable for me than Ubuntu, Fedora or even SuSE ever was.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this post (September &lsquo;17), I have the 4.12.10 kernel, and GNOME 3.24.2 and I&rsquo;ve had no freezes, bugs, or instability with anything so far.</p>

<p>Another one of the reasons why I use Arch is the package manager, Pacman.</p>

<p>Pacman runs circles around apt, dnf, zypper or any package manager you&rsquo;ve used so far, and it has package signing so you&rsquo;ll always have trusted updates (unless you turn that off, of course).</p>

<p>Someone might ask: &ldquo;Okay, but what if the software I want isn&rsquo;t in the official repos?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arch has the AUR (Arch User Repositories) to solve this problem, it&rsquo;s basically a community-maintained repo with recpies to build basically any software you can think of, they&rsquo;re even more comprehensive than Ubuntu&rsquo;s PPAs!</p>

<p>All this comes at a price, though.</p>

<p>The price is that you&rsquo;ll have to maintain your own system as Arch gives you very little by default.</p>

<p>The default installer is CLI based, so if you don&rsquo;t know the shell like the back of your hand, there will be a learning curve involved.</p>

<p>This is where the Arch docs really shine, I learned almost everything I know about Linux from the Arch Wiki.</p>

<p>It has a detailed installation guide and a dedicated beginner&rsquo;s guide for people completely new to Arch.</p>

<p>And in case you can&rsquo;t find a solution for your problem anywhere in the Wiki, you&rsquo;ll find one in the Arch forums.</p>

<p>Most people usually stay away from learning stuff like system maintenance, but I think all Linux users should learn how their system works.</p>

<p>This knowledge will come in handy when you come accross a problem with your system, I promise.</p>

<p>And in case you don&rsquo;t want to go through all this hassle to have a stable system, there are Arch-based distributions that give you basically the same experience but with a much lower learning curve, the most popular of those is Manjaro Linux.</p>
