      <description>I had a problem at work with a pattern that I think is common for database backend web applications.
Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose we have a model Device that looks like the following:
class Device(model.Model): DEVICE_TYPES = ( (&amp;#39;A&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Android&amp;#39;), (&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;iOS&amp;#39;), (&amp;#39;W&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Web&amp;#39;) ) device_type = models.CharField(max_length=1, choices=DEVICE_TYPES, default=&amp;#39;W&amp;#39;) ios_device = models.OneToOneField(AppleDevice, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True) android_device = models.OneToOneField(AndroidDevice, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True) web_device = models.OneToOneField(WebDevice, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True) Now let&amp;rsquo;s suppose that I want this device to be one of those three relationships, based on the device_type attribute.</description>

      <title>Why Arch?</title>

      <description>People have been having problems with Ubuntu recently so I proposed Arch as a replacement, but it&amp;rsquo;ll require some changes to your behavior to get a similar experience.
Arch Linux is a rolling-release distro, that means you&amp;rsquo;ll only ever need to upgrade packages since there are no formal releases.
That means you&amp;rsquo;ll always have the latest versions of the packages you have installed.
Most people think this means Arch is less stable, but this isn&amp;rsquo;t true at all, Arch has always been more stable for me than Ubuntu, Fedora or even SuSE ever was.</description>
